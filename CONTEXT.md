## Relationships

- A **Personal Server** trusts the configured SSH identity for both root and user login.
- A **Personal Server** keeps key-based root SSH enabled after bootstrap.
- A **Personal Server Connection** uses SSH rather than **Mosh Access**.
- A **Personal Server Connection** attaches the **Personal Server User** to an existing tmux session for the target project when one exists, otherwise it creates a new tmux session for that project.
- A **Personal Server Connection** names tmux sessions from the remote **Project** root path using a stable `myn-` prefixed tmux-safe name.
- A **Personal Server Connection** tmux session name lowercases the remote **Project** root path, keeps ASCII letters and digits, converts every other character run to one hyphen, trims edge hyphens, prefixes `myn-`, and uses `myn-project` if the normalized project path is empty.
- A **Personal Server Connection** fails rather than falling back to plain SSH when tmux is unavailable.
- A **Personal Server Connection** relies on the **Personal Server User** login shell PATH to find tmux.
- A **Personal Server Connection** runs its remote tmux handoff through Bash login-shell command evaluation.
- A **Personal Server Connection** trusts the saved **Personal Server Configuration** and does not require **Hetzner Credentials** or Hetzner API verification before connecting.
- A **Personal Server Connection** uses the saved IPv4 address first and falls back to the saved IPv6 address only when IPv4 is unavailable.
- A **Personal Server Connection** passes the **Personal Server User** to SSH separately with `-l` and passes IPv6 literals as unbracketed host arguments.
- A **Personal Server Connection** does not create an **Idle Lease** in the initial implementation.
- A **Personal Server Connection** requires terminal-backed stdin and stdout.
- A **Personal Server Connection** requests one SSH TTY allocation.
- A **Personal Server Connection** always passes the configured SSH identity explicitly to SSH.
- A **Personal Server Connection** uses SSH `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new`.
- A **Personal Server Connection** preserves the SSH/tmux process exit status.
- A **Personal Server Connection** validates saved configuration, local project root existence, and SSH identity existence before attempting SSH.
- A **Personal Server Connection** stays quiet on successful handoff and prints clear messages only for local validation failures.
- A **Personal Server Connection** derives the target **Project** from the first path segment under the configured local project root, not from the Git repository root.
- A **Personal Server Connection** maps local paths lexically under the configured local project root and does not resolve symlink targets for project containment.
- `myn connect` accepts no path arguments in the initial implementation and maps from the current working directory.
- When `myn connect` is run from the configured local project root itself, the configured local project root is the target **Project**.
- A **Personal Server Connection** starts in the exact mapped remote directory when it exists, otherwise the remote **Project** root when it exists, otherwise the **Personal Server User** home directory.
- A **Personal Server Connection** treats only existing remote directories as valid starting directories.
- A **Personal Server Connection** does not create missing remote project directories.
- Directory fallback affects only newly created **Personal Server Connection** tmux sessions; existing project sessions are attached as-is.
- `myn connect` fails with clear messaging when run outside the configured local project root.
- `myn configure` does not modify the user's SSH config for **Personal Server** aliases.
- All user-visible namespaces use `myn`, including config paths, environment variables, runtime lease directories, cloud resource names, Hetzner labels, bootstrap files, shell profile files, and local development launchers.
- Documentation uses **Myn** in prose and `myn` for the command name; pronunciation belongs in introductory documentation, not command help.
- Planning and decision documents keep their technical rationale but use the **Myn** namespace consistently.
- **Myn** uses the command structure `auth hetzner`, `configure`, `connect` (`c`), `idle status`, `run`, and `version`.
- **Personal Server** prompts run only after local roots and the SSH identity are configured.
- **Personal Server** creation is skipped unless a valid SSH identity is configured.
- **Personal Server** provisioning does not clone or sync projects from the local root.
- **Personal Server Bootstrap** creates the configured remote project root exactly, including spaces, owned by the **Personal Server User**.
- A **Personal Server** can only be provisioned after **Hetzner Credentials** already exist.
- **Personal Server** provisioning respects the `HCLOUD_ENDPOINT` override.
- A **Personal Server** is created in exactly one **Location**.
- A **Location** selector shows the Hetzner code plus human geography and uses the code for API calls.
- The **Location** selector defaults to `ash` when Hetzner offers it, otherwise the first available **Location** sorted by code.
- A **Personal Server** is created with exactly one non-deprecated x86_64 **Server Type** available in its **Location**, based on explicit Hetzner availability metadata.
- If the selected **Location** has no eligible **Server Type**, interactive `configure` returns to **Location** selection.
- Hetzner `Recommended` metadata is ignored for **Location** and **Server Type** defaulting.
- A **Personal Server** defaults its API-safe name to `<Personal Server User>-personal-server`.
- A **Personal Server** default server name does not include `myn`; supporting cloud resources use `myn` because they are product-managed automation artifacts.
- A **Personal Server** name is validated locally as a DNS-label-style value before creation.
- A **Personal Server** is not created when a Hetzner server with the chosen name already exists.
- A **Personal Server** uses Hetzner's latest non-deprecated Ubuntu system image, selected by highest Ubuntu version.
- A **Personal Server** is created with both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled through server creation public network options.
- Hetzner resources created for a **Personal Server** are labeled `managed_by=myn` and `role=personal_server`.
- Hetzner labels are for visibility only and are not used to auto-adopt missing **Personal Server Configuration**.
- **Myn** waits for Hetzner create actions to finish before root SSH and bootstrap polling.
- Hetzner API calls, root SSH polling, and bootstrap polling respect command cancellation.
- A **Personal Server Configuration** belongs in its own top-level config section.
- A **Personal Server Configuration** stores `serverID`, **Personal Server User**, `ipv4`, and the assigned `ipv6` address, not ongoing desired state for mutable server details.
- A **Personal Server Configuration** is incomplete for connection without `serverID`, **Personal Server User**, and at least one saved address.
- **Location**, **Server Type**, and proposed server name selections are transient until a **Personal Server** is created.
- When **Personal Server Configuration** is complete for connection, `myn configure` skips creation by default and reports the saved server ID and IP addresses.
- A complete saved **Personal Server Configuration** server ID is verified against Hetzner before creation is skipped.
- If a saved **Personal Server** server ID is missing in Hetzner, interactive `configure` asks before clearing it and non-interactive `configure` fails.
- **Personal Server** creation is interactive-only; non-interactive `configure` does not create a server.
- Missing **Hetzner Credentials** do not block saving local configuration; they only skip **Personal Server** creation.
- Interactive `configure` asks for explicit final confirmation before creating a **Personal Server**.
- A created **Personal Server** is saved in **Personal Server Configuration** even if the **Personal Server Bootstrap** fails or times out.
- `myn configure` reports user and root SSH commands with `-i` for the configured SSH identity and `-l` for the login user for both IPv4 and IPv6 after **Personal Server** creation, with IPv4 first.
- `myn configure` reports **Mosh Access** commands for the **Personal Server User** after **Personal Server** creation, with IPv4 first and the configured SSH identity passed explicitly.
- `myn configure` reports **Mosh Access** commands only after successful **Personal Server Bootstrap**.
- `myn configure` saves local roots and SSH identity before attempting **Personal Server** creation, then saves **Personal Server Configuration** after server creation succeeds.
- After **Personal Server Bootstrap** completes, `myn configure` reports installed tool versions from the completion marker.
- **Personal Server** provisioning is implemented separately from local root and SSH identity configuration.
- A **Personal Server Firewall** is created by **Myn** with an initially minimal rule set and may be expanded by the user.
- A **Personal Server Firewall** can be reused by multiple **Personal Server** instances over time.
- An existing **Personal Server Firewall** is treated as user-editable and is not reset by **Myn**.
- A newly created **Personal Server Firewall** allows inbound SSH and **Mosh Access** from all IPv4 and IPv6 sources and no other inbound access.
- **Mosh Access** uses Mosh's default UDP `60000-61000` port range.
- Existing **Personal Server Firewalls** are not modified to add **Mosh Access**.
- When `myn configure` reuses an existing **Personal Server Firewall**, it reports that firewall rules are left untouched and **Mosh Access** may require the user-managed UDP rule.
- A **Personal Server SSH Key** is reused when Hetzner already has the same public key fingerprint.
- Supporting resources created for a **Personal Server** are not automatically cleaned up if server creation fails.
- A **Personal Server User** is derived from the current local username as a lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens value.
- If the local username cannot be normalized into a valid **Personal Server User**, `myn configure` prompts for one.
- A **Personal Server User** starts with Bash as the login shell.
- A **Personal Server User** belongs to the `sudo` and `docker` groups.
- A **Personal Server User** has sudo access, but sudo requires a password.
- Membership in the `docker` group is accepted as root-equivalent development-machine access.
- A **Personal Server User** password is collected for provisioning, confirmed, required to be non-empty, sent to cloud-init as a SHA-512 crypt hash, and not saved in config.
- A **Server Type** default is the available option closest to 21 EUR monthly gross price, breaking ties by dedicated over shared, then RAM, then vCPU.
- A **Server Type** label reflects Hetzner's actual storage type and includes the Hetzner API name.
- Final **Personal Server** creation confirmation shows one maximum monthly gross EUR total from Hetzner live pricing for billable resources **Myn** is about to provision when pricing can be fetched, and explicitly says price is unavailable otherwise.
- A **Personal Server Bootstrap** runs through cloud-init during server creation.
- **Personal Server Bootstrap** cloud-init user data is rendered through a typed Go render function using a YAML library.
- A **Personal Server Bootstrap** installs the latest Ubuntu security updates after the **Personal Server** is created, enables unattended security upgrades, and reboots automatically if required.
- **Personal Server Bootstrap** installs `mosh` as an apt-managed system package for **Mosh Access**.
- A **Personal Server Bootstrap** installs Docker Engine and the compose plugin from Docker's official apt repository.
- **Personal Server** creation is not considered complete until the **Personal Server Bootstrap** finishes.
- The **Personal Server Bootstrap** writes a completion marker with status, timestamp, reboot information, and installed tool versions that **Myn** polls for over root SSH.
- The **Personal Server Bootstrap** completion marker reports the installed `mosh` version.
- The **Personal Server Bootstrap** must finish within five minutes after the **Personal Server** first accepts root SSH.
- Automatic reboot downtime counts against the five-minute **Personal Server Bootstrap** timeout.
- The **Personal Server Bootstrap** install plan is shown before final creation confirmation.
- The **Personal Server Bootstrap** install plan groups system services, Homebrew tools, and coding agents separately.
- Homebrew and Homebrew-installed tools belong to the **Personal Server User**, not root.
- **Personal Server Bootstrap** does not copy local dotfiles or shell configuration beyond required Homebrew, nvm, Git identity setup, and the repo-owned **Personal Server tmux Profile**.
- **Personal Server Bootstrap** installs the **Personal Server tmux Profile** for the **Personal Server User** instead of reading the user's local `~/.tmux.conf` at provisioning time.
- Every new **Personal Server** receives the **Personal Server tmux Profile** without an extra prompt or saved configuration flag.
- **Personal Server Bootstrap** writes the **Personal Server tmux Profile** during creation; this does not define a later repair or update policy for user-edited tmux configuration.
- The **Personal Server tmux Profile** is installed as `/home/<Personal Server User>/.tmux.conf`, owned by the **Personal Server User**, not as system-wide tmux configuration.
- The **Personal Server tmux Profile** is a literal snapshot of the intended tmux settings, not a curated subset.
- The repo-owned **Personal Server tmux Profile** is the source of truth after it is seeded; tests and provisioning do not compare against the user's live local `~/.tmux.conf`.
- The **Personal Server Bootstrap** install plan does not call out the **Personal Server tmux Profile** separately from the standard tool setup.
- `tmux` is installed through Homebrew as part of the **Personal Server Bootstrap**.
- `rustup` is installed through Homebrew, but no Rust toolchain is installed during the **Personal Server Bootstrap**.
- Go is installed through the Homebrew `go` formula during the **Personal Server Bootstrap**.
- GitHub CLI is installed through Homebrew, but GitHub authentication is not configured by **Personal Server Bootstrap**.
- Git identity on the **Personal Server** matches available local Git identity values, read from global Git config first and repo-local Git config second, and reports skipped missing values.
- `nvm` is installed through Homebrew, initialized for the **Personal Server User**, and used to install and default the latest LTS Node.js.
- Codex is installed as the **Personal Server User** with the nvm-managed LTS Node.js npm.
- Claude Code is installed as the **Personal Server User** with its official installer script.
- Coding agent installation failures do not fail the **Personal Server Bootstrap**; they are reported as partial failures.
- **Personal Server Bootstrap** hard-fails system update/security setup, user creation, SSH authorization, remote project root creation, Homebrew, Docker, core Homebrew tools, nvm, and LTS Node/npm setup.
- **Personal Server Bootstrap** hard-fails writing the **Personal Server tmux Profile**.
- **Personal Server Bootstrap** hard-fails `mosh` installation because **Mosh Access** is default Personal Server access.
- A **Stdio Lease** is active only while the wrapped command still exists and terminal input or output is recent.
- A quiet **Stdio Lease** can become idle while the wrapped command is still waiting at a prompt.
- A completed **Stdio Lease** is removed on normal wrapper exit.
- An expired **Idle Lease** is stale, not merely idle.
- **Idle Lease** heartbeat is distinct from terminal activity.
- A **Stdio Lease** defaults to a 30 minute idle window.
- `myn idle status` reports **Idle Lease** state without removing lease files.
- A **Stdio Lease** requires a terminal-backed stdin and stdout.

## Example dialogue

> **Domain expert:** "Homebrew — it belongs with the user-owned development tools."
> **Dev:** "Should the **Personal Server tmux Profile** come from the user's live local `~/.tmux.conf`?"
> **Domain expert:** "No — **Myn** should install a repo-owned tmux profile so Personal Server provisioning stays reproducible."
> **Dev:** "Should the **Personal Server tmux Profile** be curated or a literal snapshot of the intended local tmux settings?"
> **Domain expert:** "Use a literal snapshot."
> **Dev:** "Should installing the **Personal Server tmux Profile** be optional during creation?"
> **Domain expert:** "No — every new Personal Server should receive it as part of the standard development environment."
> **Dev:** "If a later bootstrap-like flow finds an existing tmux config, should this decision require preserving it?"
> **Domain expert:** "No — this decision only says creation writes the standard profile; future repair or update behavior is separate."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "remote machine" and "default server" both refer to **Personal Server** in this context.
- "region" was used to mean **Location** — resolved: the CLI uses **Location** everywhere.
- "lease" does not mean a permanent lock — resolved: an **Idle Lease** is renewable evidence of recent activity.
- "same tmux settings" does not mean live dotfile sync — resolved: **Personal Server Bootstrap** installs a repo-owned **Personal Server tmux Profile**.
